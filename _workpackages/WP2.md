## Objectives

The goal of this WP is to provide the "client" view for the LEM components—i.e., the specification of interfaces that executable domain-specific modeling languages (xDSMLs) and language workbenches need to efficiently and effectively use LEM.

WP2 proceeds in parallel with WP1 to ensure that xDSMLs match the specific IF and DM components developed by WP1. This WP also requires input from WP4 such that developments align with selected case studies.

## Partner Contributions

**U.Rennes:** Leads the development of the modeling interface for live and exploratory modeling, bringing expertise in xDSML design and language runtimes.

**JKU:** Contributes expertise in design space exploration (DSE) and search-based model transformations, ensuring the DSE interface effectively supports alternative model configuration exploration.

## Tasks

#### Task T2.1: Modeling Interface for Live and Exploratory Modeling (Lead: U.Rennes)

**Description:** Design of a modeling interface that bridges LEM with xDSMLs, supporting real-time interaction with models. Users can modify, analyze, and experiment with models dynamically while maintaining consistency with xDSML semantics. The interface enhances user experience with intuitive controls for live execution, state inspection, and incremental refinements.

**Challenge:** Ensuring responsiveness and consistency of the interface while handling complex model changes in real time.

#### Task T2.2: Modeling Interface for Design Space Exploration (Lead: JKU)

**Description:** Development of a modeling interface enabling Design Space Exploration (DSE) for xDSMLs. The interface allows users to define, visualize, generate, and navigate alternative model configurations, constraints, and objectives while integrating exploration algorithms. The goal is to facilitate informed decision-making through interactive guidance, real-time feedback, and optimization techniques.
